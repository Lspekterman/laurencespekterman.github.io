## About
Currently seeking a position in data analytics for a collaborative, fast-paced, and challenging environment. I like solving problems using a data driven approach.

I earned my MBA with a focus in Data Analytics at The Yale School of Management in May 2024. I earned my MS Ed in Education Science from Johns Hopkins. I also have a BA from the University of Maryland, College Park.

My professional interests focus broadly on the application of data based decision making in the education and social sector. I am also interested in the relationship between data and marketing strategy (i.e., LTV, Segmentation, Marketing ROI).

When not running analyses, I can usually be found training for a marathon or watching reality TV.
